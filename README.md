# Vaporizer Control Crafty ( VCC ) #

![](art/icon.png)

##Why?##

 - The app from the vendor is to slow in showing battery state. I especilally disliked that a progress indicator always visually blocked the for me most important info - the battery state
 - As the app was not free software there was no fdroid version and there are some Android users that just run free software ( respect! ) So e.g. Richard Stallman can now use the device
 - possible wear extension ( I could imagine this handy - but I have no wear device yet )
 - in the states where weed is legal we could have presettings for cannabis ( THC / CBD / .. )
 - perhaps I get some samples to try in my crafty - I am really happy about any legal samples ( no tobacco please ) and cannabis up to 15g as this is the maximum I can own without penalty in Berlin at the moment ;-)

##Feedback##
